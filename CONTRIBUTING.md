# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

If you want to suggest a feature or notify us about a bug, please use the issue tracker.

Contributions to the internal verification info database might not be accepted at this time.

If you need help with development or have questions it's recommended to join the AppVerifier room on Matrix at
https://matrix.to/#/#appverifier:matrix.org and ask for help there from [soupslurpr](https://github.com/soupslurpr),
the lead developer.

Java code is not accepted, we will only use Kotlin and Rust if needed (this project is currently 100% Rust free).

Views should be avoided at all costs and only Jetpack Compose should be used unless there is no other way, but it
has to be very important (unlikely).
