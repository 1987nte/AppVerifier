If you want to suggest a feature or notify us about a bug, please use the issue tracker.

If you need help with development or have questions its recommended to join the AppVerifier room on matrix at
https://matrix.to/#/#appverifier:matrix.org and ask for help there from [soupslurpr](https://github.com/soupslurpr),
the lead developer.

Java code is not accepted, we will only use Kotlin and Rust if needed (this project is currently 100% Rust free).

Views should be avoided at all costs and only Jetpack Compose should be used unless there is no other way, but it
has to be very important (unlikely).
